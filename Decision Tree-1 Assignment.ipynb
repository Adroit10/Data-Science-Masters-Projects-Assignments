    "A decision tree classifier is a popular machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It's a tree-like model where each internal node represents a decision based on the value of a particular feature, each branch represents the outcome of that decision, and each leaf node represents the final prediction or classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm starts with the entire dataset at the root of the tree. The algorithm evaluates different features and selects the one that, based on certain criteria (e.g., Gini impurity, information gain, or entropy), provides the best split. The selected feature becomes the decision node. The dataset is split into subsets based on the chosen feature. Each subset represents a different branch from the decision node. Steps 2 and 3 are recursively applied to each subset until a stopping condition is met. This condition could be a predefined depth limit, a minimum number of samples per leaf, or a certain level of purity in the leaf nodes. Steps 2 and 3 are recursively applied to each subset until a stopping condition is met. This condition could be a predefined depth limit, a minimum number of samples per leaf, or a certain level of purity in the leaf nodes. To make predictions, new data points traverse the decision tree from the root to a leaf, following the decisions at each node.

    "The mathematical intuition behind decision tree classification involves concepts like impurity measures, information gain, and recursive partitioning. Let's break down the key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Impurity measure:\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision tree algorithm aims to create splits in the data that maximize the homogeneity or purity of the resulting subsets. The impurity of a node is quantified using measures like Gini impurity, entropy, or classification error.\n",
    "For a given node t, the Gini Impurity I(t) is given as :\n",
    "\n",
    "I(t) = 1 - ∑(i=1 to C) p(i∣t)^2\n",
    "\n",
    "Where C is the number of classes and p(i|t) is the proportion of instances of class i at node t.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Information Gain:\n",
    "\n",
    "Information Gain is used to determine the effectiveness of a feature in reducing impurity. It is calculated by comparing the impurity before and after a split.\n",

    "Once the recursive splitting process is complete, the leaf nodes contain the final predictions. For classification, the majority class in the leaf node is assigned as the predicted class.\n",
    "The training process involves finding the optimal feature and split point at each node to maximize Information Gain. This is often done using algorithms like CART (Classification and Regression Trees).\n",
