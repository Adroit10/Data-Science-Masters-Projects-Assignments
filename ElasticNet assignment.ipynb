    "Elastic Net regression is the combination of both Ridge (L2 regularization) and Lasso (L1 regularization) penalties in its objective function.  It was introduced to overcome some limitations of Lasso and Ridge Regression and aims to provide a more balanced regularization approach. Elastic Net is particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional datasets with a large number of features, and it can handle situations where there is multicollinearity among predictors. It allows for both sparsity and shrinkage of coefficients. The balance between the two is controlled by the hyperparameter alpha."

    "Advantages:: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Can handle multicollinearity: effective in handling multicollinearity, which is a situation where predictor variables are highly correlated. The combination of L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) penalties allows Elastic Net to address correlated features and select relevant variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Similar to Lasso Regression, Elastic Net can perform automatic feature selection by setting some coefficients exactly to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The hyperparameter alpha allows users to control the balance between L1 and L2 regularization. This flexibility enables the model to adapt to different scenarios, providing a good compromise between sparsity (Lasso) and shrinkage (Ridge).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Elastic Net is well-suited for datasets with a large number of features, where traditional linear regression may struggle with overfitting. It helps prevent overfitting by incorporating regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages ::\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The introduction of hyperparameter alpha adds complexity to the model and chosing the best set of values for alpha and lambda becomes a challenging task.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Elastic Net may be computationally more expensive than simpler regression models due to the additional penalties and the need for hyperparameter tuning. This can be a concern, especially for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In certain cases, specialized models designed for specific types of data patterns (e.g., decision trees for non-linear relationships) may outperform Elastic Net. Elastic Net is most effective when there is a balance between feature sparsity and coefficient shrinkage."

    "Interpreting the coefficients in Elastic Net Regression is similar to interpreting coefficients in other regression models, but with considerations for the combination of L1 and L2 regularization. As in linear regression, the magnitude and sign of the coefficients indicate the strength and direction of the relationship between each feature and the target variable. Larger absolute values imply a stronger impact, and the sign indicates the direction of the relationship. Features with non-zero coefficients are selected as important predictors in the model. The selection is influenced by both the L1 penalty (sparsity) and the L2 penalty (shrinkage). The choice of alpha determines the trade-off between L1 and L2 penalties. A higher alpha value ince=reases the emphasis on sparsity(L1) and lower alpha emphasises shrinkage(L2). "

    "Handling missing values is an important preprocessing step because the presence of missing values can have an adverse affect on the model performance. Few techniques implemented to handle missing values are :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Imputation: One common approach is to impute missing values with estimated values. This could involve replacing missing values with the mean, median, or mode of the respective feature. Imputation helps retain observations with missing data and avoids the exclusion of entire rows.\n",

    "2. Depending on the nature of the data, you might use more sophisticated imputation methods, such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN) imputation or regression imputation. These methods estimate missing values based on relationships with other variables.\n",
