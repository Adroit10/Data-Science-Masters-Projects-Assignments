    "Multiprocessing is as package that supports spawning processes using an API similar to the threading module. Multiprocessing refers to the ability of a system to support more than one processor at the same time. Applications in a multiprocessing system are broken to smaller routines that run independantly. The operating system allocates these threads to the processors improving performance of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a single processor and it is assigned several processes at the same time it will have to interrupt each task and switch briefly to another to keep the processes going. It becomes difficult to keep track of all the processes thus multiprocessing is used. Here the CPU can easily execute several tasks at once with each task using its own processor."
