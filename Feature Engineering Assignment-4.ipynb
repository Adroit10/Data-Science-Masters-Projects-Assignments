    "Data encoding refers to the process of converting data from one format to another. In the context of data science, encoding is often used to represent data in a specific format that is suitable for analysis, storage, or transmission.

    "The choice of encoding technique depends on the nature of the categorical data and whether there is any meaningful ordinal relationship among the categories. In general, if the categorical variable has no inherent order or ranking, and there is no ordinal relationship among the categories, nominal encoding is a suitable choice. This involves assigning a unique numerical identifier to each category.  Nominal encoding provides a simple and compact representation of the categorical variable with a single numerical column. This can be advantageous in terms of both computational efficiency and model interpretability. If the dataset has a relatively small number of unique values (in this case, 5), using one-hot encoding would result in five binary columns. While this might be manageable if we do not have many columns in our dataset, it could lead to a slight increase in dimensionality. Nominal encoding, on the other hand, keeps the data in a single column, preventing dimensionality explosion."
