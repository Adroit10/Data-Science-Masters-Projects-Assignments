    "  1. Descriptive Statistics: In this type of statistics, the data is summarised  through the given observations.Descriptive statistics is a way to organise, represent and describe a collection of data using tables, graphs, and summary measures. For example, the collection of people in a city using the internet or using Television. It includes measure of central tendancy, dispersion, frequency, and position.\n",

Or we can say, it is used to draw conclusions from the data that depends on random variations such as observational errors, sampling variation, etc. For example, deriving estimates from hypothetical research."

    "Levels of measurement, also called scales of measurement, tell you how precisely variables are recorded. The different levels of measurement of data are:\n",
    "   1. Nominal data: Nominal data is a type of data that represents discrete units which is why it cannot be ordered and measured. They are used to label variables without providing any quantitative value. Also, they have no meaningful zero.Some examples of nominal data include\n",
    "              Gender ( Male, Female)\n",
    "              Hair color ( Black, Brown, Gray, etc)\n",

    "              \n",
    "              \n",
    "   2. ordinal data: Ordinal values represent discrete as well as ordered units. Unlike nominal, here the ordering matters. However, there is no consistency in the relative distance between the adjacent categories. And, similar to nominal data, ordinal data also don't have a meaningful zero. Examples of ordinal data:\n",
    "           Opinion (agree, mostly agree, neutral, mostly disagree, disagree)\n",
    "           Socioeconomic status (low income, middle income, high income)\n",
    "      \n",
    "      \n",
    "   3. Interval data: It represents ordered data that is measured along a numerical scale with equal distances between the adjacent units. These equal distances are also referred to as intervals. So a variable contains interval data if it has ordered numeric values with the exact differences known between them. Interval data can be continuous or discrete.Examples of Interval data:\n",
    "           IQ testâ€™s intelligence scale\n",
    "           Time if measured using a 12-hour clock\n",
    "      You can compare the data with interval data and add/subtract the values but cannot multiply or divide as it doesn't have a meaningful zero.\n",
    "      \n",
    "   4. Ratio data: Like Interval data, ratio data are also ordered with the same difference between the individual units. However, they also have a meaningful zero so they cannot take negative values.Examples of ratio data:\n",
    "           Temperature on a Kelvin scale (0 degrees represent total absence of thermal energy)\n",
    "           Height ( zero is the starting point)\n",
    "      Now with real zero points, we can also multiply and divide the numbers. Besides, you can sort the values as well. "
