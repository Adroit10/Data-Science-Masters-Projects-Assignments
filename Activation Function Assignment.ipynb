    "An activation function is a crucial component in artificial neural networks, serving as the mathematical operation applied to the input of a node or neuron in order to determine its output. The activation function introduces non-linearities to the network, allowing it to model complex relationships in the data.\n",
    "In a neural network, each node or neuron receives input signals, performs a weighted sum of these inputs, and then applies the activation function to produce an output. This output is then passed on to the next layer of neurons as input. The activation function plays a key role in determining whether a neuron should be activated (i.e., contribute to the output) or not, based on the weighted sum of its inputs."

    "Activation functions play a crucial role in the training process and performance of a neural network. Here are some ways in which activation functions can impact the network :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Non-Linearity and Model Complexity : Activation functions introduce non-linearities to the network. This non-linearity is essential for the network to learn and model complex relationships in the data. Without non-linear activation functions, a neural network would essentially reduce to a linear model, limiting its capacity to represent intricate patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Gradient Descent and Backpropagation : During the training process, neural networks use optimization algorithms like gradient descent to adjust the weights and biases to minimize the error. The choice of activation function affects the gradients computed during backpropagation. Smooth and differentiable activation functions are preferable, as they facilitate gradient-based optimization methods. Some activation functions can lead to vanishing or exploding gradient problems. Vanishing gradients occur when the gradients become very small during backpropagation, causing the network to learn very slowly or not at all. Exploding gradients occur when gradients become too large, leading to instability during training. Activation functions like sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent are more prone to vanishing gradients, especially in deep networks. ReLU and its variants help mitigate the vanishing gradient problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Activation functions that saturate (output very large or very small values) can limit the range of values the network can produce. Sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent, for example, saturate for extreme input values. This can result in poor weight updates and slow convergence. ReLU and its variants, by contrast, do not saturate for positive input values, allowing for a broader range of outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. ReLU and its variants induce sparsity in the network by setting some neuron activations to zero. This sparsity can lead to more efficient representations and reduce the computational load. However, it's important to consider issues like \"dead neurons\" (neurons that always output zero) in the case of ReLU, which can occur if a large gradient flows through a ReLU unit during training."

    "The sigmoid activation function, also known as the logistic function, is a common non-linear activation function used in artificial neural networks. It maps any real-valued number to the range of [0,1] \n",

    "1. The sigmoid function tends to saturate for extreme input values, causing the gradient to become very small. This can lead to the vanishing gradient problem, where the weights of the network are updated very slowly, hindering learning. This is especially problematic in deep networks.\n",

    "2. The outputs of the sigmoid function are centered around 0.5 when the input is 0. This can create issues during training, especially when the outputs need to be centered around zero.\n",
