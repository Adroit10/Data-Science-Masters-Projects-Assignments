    "Estimation statistics involves using sample data to make inferences or estimates about population parameters. These estimates help researchers and analysts draw conclusions about a population based on limited information from a sample. There are two main types of estimates: point estimates and interval estimates.\n",

    "\n",
    "Point estimate:\n",
    "\n",
    "A point estimate is a single numerical value that is used to approximate a population parameter. It is derived from sample data and serves as the best guess or single value that is assumed to be close to the true, unknown population parameter. For example, if you want to estimate the average height of a population based on a sample, the sample mean would be the point estimate for the population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Interval Estimate:\n",
    "\n",
    "An interval estimate, on the other hand, provides a range of values within which the true population parameter is likely to lie. It recognizes the uncertainty inherent in making estimates based on a sample and provides a measure of the precision or confidence associated with the estimate. The most common form of interval estimate is the confidence interval, which specifies a range of values and an associated level of confidence that the true parameter falls within that range. For example, a 95% confidence interval for the average height might be from 65 inches to 75 inches."
