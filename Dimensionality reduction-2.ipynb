    "In the context of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a projection refers to the transformation of data points from their original feature space to a new space formed by the principal components. The principal components are linear combinations of the original features, and they are chosen in such a way that they capture the maximum variance in the data.\n",
    "PCA is used for dimensionality reduction, and the projection onto the principal components allows for a lower-dimensional representation of the data while retaining as much variance as possible. The first few principal components often capture the most significant patterns in the data, allowing for a simplified representation that can be useful for various tasks, such as visualization, feature selection, or model training."

The primary goal of PCA is to reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining as much of its original variability as possible.

By choosing the eigenvectors associated with the largest eigenvalues, PCA ensures that the directions of maximum variance are retained in the reduced-dimensional space.\n",
